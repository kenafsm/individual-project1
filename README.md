The final result of the project is based on the mockup, but there were few changes that makes the actual project different from the mockup.

In the mockup, i made the top articles content position in the middle of two sections and also i made the slider navigation button with arrows on the side. In the middle of actualization, i couldn't replicate the design and change them to the final result version.

Windows Tide by Picsart 
The color pallete was chosen because i personally like Blue and i was looking to find a gradation of Blue color that's neither too contrast nor too soft.

- Font

"Montserrat"
Montserrat has been my favorite font because the composition isn't really that stiff and most of graphic designers use this font.

## Description :

The Title of this project is Ken's Blog. It's a static personal blog that contains personal information, articles/blogs, and gallery. The main page is the home page where it introduces the whole contents of the website. To make sure that this project doesn't look too basic, I added some animations just to give some cherry on top to the project. To make sure this project compatible to several display, I added some media queries to each page so it can be responsive to almost any type of display. This project inspired by so many other projects that i found from YouTube, W3School, MDN, and as a helping tool i also use ChatGPT as a reference. All the concept was made by myself through process of brainstorm, designing mockups, and creating the project for about 3 days.

## Summary :

There are rooms for this project's improvement. In my opinion, the responsivity has worked pretty well but it has some flaws that can be fixed in the future. With all my ability, this is the best that i can do to create this project from the beginning to the final result. Feedbacks will be received with pleasure.
